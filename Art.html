        <p>Rangoli is a traditional Indian art form, often created during festivals like Diwali, Onam, and Pongal. It involves creating intricate designs and patterns on the ground, typically at the entrance of homes, to welcome guests and deities. Rangoli designs are usually made using colorful powders, rice, flower petals, or even sand. This vibrant and festive art form is not only a decoration but also symbolizes prosperity, happiness, and good luck.</p>
        
        <p>The word "Rangoli" comes from the Sanskrit words "Rang" (color) and "Aavalli" (row), which together mean a "row of colors." The patterns in Rangoli vary from simple geometric shapes to elaborate depictions of animals, flowers, and religious symbols. The design is often created using symmetrical or radial patterns and can be as simple or complex as desired.</p>
        
        <p>While Rangoli is predominantly an art form associated with Hindu culture, it has been embraced across India in various forms, with each region adding its own flair. From the delicate Kolam designs of Tamil Nadu to the bright floral Rangolis of Maharashtra, this art form is a visual feast of colors and creativity.</p>
