            <h2>Introduction to Brahmagupta</h2>
            <p>
                Brahmagupta was an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer who lived from 598–668 AD. He made significant contributions to mathematics, especially in the fields of algebra, geometry, and number theory. Brahmagupta’s works laid the foundations for many later mathematical advancements and influenced both Indian and global mathematics.

            <h2>Key Contributions of Brahmagupta</h2>
            <p>
                Brahmagupta’s contributions span multiple areas of mathematics, but his key contributions include:
            </p>
            <div class="contribution">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Introduction of Zero:</strong> Brahmagupta defined zero as a number and developed rules for its use in arithmetic operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative Numbers:</strong> He also worked with negative numbers and developed rules for their manipulation in arithmetic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quadratic Equations:</strong> Brahmagupta gave solutions to quadratic equations, marking one of the earliest known treatments of algebra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arithmetic Progression and Geometric Progression:</strong> Brahmagupta provided formulas for both, which were later used in advanced mathematical theories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Area of Cycles (Circles):</strong> He developed a formula for calculating the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle).</li>

            <h2>His Major Work: Brahmasphutasiddhanta</h2>
            <p>
                Brahmagupta’s major work, *Brahmasphutasiddhanta*, written in 628 AD, is a comprehensive text that covers a wide range of mathematical and astronomical topics. It contains his discoveries regarding arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, including the rules for solving quadratic equations and working with zero and negative numbers.

            <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
            <p>
                Brahmagupta’s work influenced later mathematicians such as Al-Khwarizmi in the Islamic world and provided the foundation for much of the modern understanding of algebra and number theory. His contributions to mathematics and astronomy were groundbreaking and continue to be recognized today.
